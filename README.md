### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Favourite language: Ruby
Least favourite: those that claim to be OOP by dint of retrofitting kludgy support for OOP as a kind of bolt on extra.

BTW Ruby works well for Functional programming too.

Not much sctive coding these days. Still plenty of debugging others offerings though...I seem to attract bugs,must try using more citronella.

Being kind of lazy if you want to know more about me catch me on <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@TheExecEditor">Fosstodon</a>
